# Gary's Economics Github

This is an experiment to set up a part of Gary's web presence for people who want to learn more about his ideas.

Currently there are two Github projects

1. A Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page, to which the community can contribute both Questions and Answers.

2. A Transcript Archive for all Gary's videos, which aspires to be a searchable knowledge-base.
